  "body": "# ZoneMinder Slack Bot\r\n\r\nThis is a [Slack Bot](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) that monitors one or more [Slack](https://slack.com) channels for commands and interacts with a [ZoneMinder](https://www.zoneminder.com/) system to report events and\r\nobtain information.\r\n\r\nThe primary use for this bot is to allow access to some parts of a ZoneMinder system that is behind a firewall, without having to expose the actual system to the Internet. Making a ZoneMinder system available to the Internet has several requirements (static IP, secure system) that may not be feasible for all users.\r\n\r\nBy providing a bot that can interact with both ZoneMinder and Slack, remote access to and notification from ZoneMinder is possible, without needing a static IP and using the security provided by the Slack environment.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Easiest : Using pip\r\n\r\nThe easiest method of installation is via `pip` as the package is available\r\nfrom the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n> pip install zonebot\r\n```    \r\n\r\nThis will create a script called `zonebot` in your path (\"`which zonebot`\" will tell\r\nyou exactly where) that you can run.\r\n\r\n### Download source and build\r\n\r\nYou can download the source from GitHub and build it yourself if you would like.\r\n\r\n1. Download the release you want from https://github.com/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot/releases\r\n1. Extract it\r\n1. Run `python setup.py build install`\r\n\r\n### Clone the source and build\r\n\r\nYou can also clone the source from GitHub if you would like to build the very latest version. **This is not guaranteed to work**. The unreleased source code from GitHub could be in the middle of development and running it directly is not recommended.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository https://github.com/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot\r\n1. Run `python setup.py build install`\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAlso installed is a sample configuration file called `zonebot-example-config.cfg`.\r\nYou can copy this to your preferred location for config files and edit it to put in\r\nyour [Slack API token](https://api.slack.com/tokens) and the\r\n[ID of your bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)\r\n\r\nThe example configuration file is installed into the Python package directory on\r\nyour system, which can be somewhat difficult to find. The latest version of the\r\nfile is always available from\r\n[the GitHub repository](https://github.com/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot/blob/master/docs/zonebot-example-config.cfg)\r\nif needed.\r\n\r\nTo configure the bot, you will need several pieces of information\r\n\r\n1. Your Slack API token. This can be found by\r\n    1. Going to the [Slack Bot user page](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) and creating a new bot user. You will have a chance to get the API token here\r\n    2. Going to the page for your [existing bot user](https://my.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations).\r\n2. The User ID of your bot user. This can be found by:\r\n    1. Running the script `zonebot-getid` distributed with this package and providing the name of the Slack bot user and you Slack API token as command line options. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n> zonebot-getid  -a \"your-slack-token\" -b zoneminder\r\n> User ID for bot 'zoneminder' is AA22BB44C\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have those, make a copy of the config file and add the Slack API token and user ID of the bot, You will also want to edit the `Permissions` section.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The default config file allows only read permission to the ZoneMinder system.\r\n\r\nThe default config file can be placed in any of these locations (checked in this order)\r\n\r\n* Any file specified by the `-c/--config` command line option\r\n* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zonebot/zonebot.conf` if the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable is defined\r\n* `${DIR}/zonebot/zonebot.conf` for any directory in the `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` environment variable\r\n* `~/.config/zonebot/zonebot.conf`\r\n* `/etc/zonebot/zonebot.conf`\r\n* `/etc/default/zonebot`\r\n\r\nBuilding and Contributing\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nInstructions for building the ZoneMinder Slack bot are in the `docs/BUILDING.md`\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot)\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot?branch=master)\r\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/zonebot.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zonebot)\r\n[![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/57def689037c2000458f770d/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/57def689037c2000458f770d)\r\n[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/github/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot/master/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/github/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot/master)\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute, pull requests against the\r\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/rjclark/zoneminder-slack-bot) are welcomed.\r\n",
